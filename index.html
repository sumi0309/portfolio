          <p>
            This software system, named Up-To-Date, is a news aggregator web
            application designed to keep users informed about local events and
            news in their neighborhood. The application caters to various user
            roles, allowing individuals to sign in, submit news articles with
            timestamps and locations, search for news using relevant keywords,
            delete news items, and suggest modifications or contribute
            additional information.

          <p>
            Designed using <strong>MVC architecture</strong> in
            <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>, leveraging Razor Pages for dynamic
            interfaces and Microsoft SQL Server for backend database management,
            the application ensures efficient handling of user interactions and
            robust data storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary goal of Up-To-Date is to provide a platform where users
            can stay current with the latest happenings in their area, enhancing
            community engagement and information sharing. The system includes
            features to ensure ease of use while effectively managing news
            content and user interactions, making it a valuable tool for local

        <p>
          A Python-based software application for analyzing GitHub repository
          issues.

            This project involved developing a software application that
            utilized a JSON data file containing comprehensive information about
            GitHub repository issues. The application processed this data to
            extract meaningful insights and generate graphs showcasing important
            events and trends within the repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            By analyzing and visualizing the data, the application provided a
            clear understanding of issue activity, helping to identify
            bottlenecks, popular topics, and overall repository health. The
            project was implemented entirely in <strong>Python</strong>,
            leveraging libraries for data processing and visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this project, I not only enhanced my technical skills but
            also recognized the importance of teamwork, thoroughly enjoying my
            role as a developer. It was a rewarding experience to see how
            collaborative efforts could transform raw data into actionable
            insights.

        <h3>Smart Attendance Portal</h3>
        <p>
          A patented software application developed to automate the
          attendance-taking process for professors.
          <span class="read-more">[Read More]</span>
        </p>
        <div

          <p>
            This software was developed to ease the attendance-taking process of
            professors at our university. The manual process of marking
            attendance was automated using <strong>FaceApi.js</strong>, a
            powerful library for face recognition and detection. Professors
            could simply upload a group picture of their class onto the
            application, and the system would automatically recognize each
            student and mark their attendance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system utilized
            <strong>FaceApi.js</strong> for backend facial recognition
            processing and <strong>React</strong> for a dynamic, user-friendly
            frontend. This combination enhanced both the efficiency and user
            experience of the application, offering a seamless interface and
            robust performance for large classrooms and multiple sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            By leveraging advanced technologies and focusing on scalability,
            this project not only simplified attendance tracking but also
            demonstrated innovation in applying AI and web development for
            educational purposes.
